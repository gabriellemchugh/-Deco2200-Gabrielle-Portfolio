            <p class = "centre">Currently, moving house is strenuous and time consuming process that is considered a negative experience by most. Every step involved pain points such as packing and organising belongings, physical strain and security of items.
We hypothesis that the time and effort required in moving house could be relieved by the user of autonomous vehicles. So, we have created an autonomous removal service to create a less-taxing, efficient and streamlined process of moving houses. Our process lead us down many different routes, but with user testing we honed our focus on a simple organisation and booking service that efficiently delivers all there items to multiple locations in accordance with their needs. .</p>

<p>The next step in the design process of ‘Autonomove’, colour, shape and detail were added to the wireframe to create the High Fidelity mock up showcased. The process of achieving this final design involved user testing, iteration and much altercation. The desired app would need to provide a sleek user interface with relevant colours, and provide a comfortable and clear user experience.<br><br>

To understand which colour palette would be most comfortable and usable for users, the sign up screen was tested with users in different colours using Invision. These think-aloud observations  predominately took place in the environment of a home, as well as exterior to the houses on the street to replicate the real life process. It was concluded that green and red felt the most natural, supportive and non-confronting to users. The brighter blue and red pallet was enjoyed by users but didn’t provide as much clarity as the bold colours were competing for users attention.<br><br>

To proceed with the green and red colour scheme a high fidelity mock up was created with Adobe XD. This resource was efficient and provided ideal animation and simple arrows for user flow.
This design was then tested with users, and produced great insights that were not picked up on in the wireframe. It was observed that the back arrow ‘<‘ was too large, causing an uneven ratio and thus a more confused User Interface. The headings were moved to the left so the interface had clear lines. Some of the text was too small and was increased in size.<br>

Finally, we achieved our desired product with a non-confronting and usable interface, as showcased below in a user flow diagram. The Adobe XD usable prototype is showcased above.
