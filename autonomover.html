We hypothesis that the time and effort required in moving house could be relieved by the user of autonomous vehicles. So, we have created an autonomous removal service to create a less-taxing, efficient and streamlined process of moving houses. Our process lead us down many different routes, but with user testing we honed our focus on a simple organisation and booking service that efficiently delivers all there items to multiple locations in accordance with their needs. .</p>

Autonomove was first designed using paper prototyping, iterated on based off feedback from the initial design put forward. This initial feedback revealed issues with the consistency in the user interaction and confusion in the process the of using the design. The design had to become more streamlined to limit user error but still provide wide customisation for users

<p>The first wireframe was a direct transition of the concept from the paper prototype into a sketch file then into inVision. It was strictly colourless with the aim of being able to visualise and experience the features and flow of the design in a more realistic experience.
</p>

<h6>PROBLEMS</h6>

<p>After testing the first wireframe during an evaluation session it was revealed that users felt confused with the layout and flow of the design, unable to distinguish between interactive and non-responsive features. This lead to miscommunication between the interface and the user therefore making the user unclear on the aim and process of the concept. These problems were enhanced by the visual design, which was inconsistent across screens.</p>


<h6>ITERATION 2</h6>
<div class = "imgs">
  <img src = "./img/autonomover/1.png">
  <img src = "./img/autonomover/2.png">
  <img src = "./img/autonomover/3.png">

</div>

<p> As a result of the first evaluation session when designing the second iteration there was a focus on consistency in the layout. The second iteration had a simplified design to create an understanding for the user about which elements required interaction. By implementing this, the user flow would still be similar however it was hoped that it would be a clearer more understandable journey.</p>

<h6>PROBLEMS</h6>

<p> After conducting the second evaluation session, users revealed they had a better understanding of the flow and were less hesitant and confused. There were still inconsistencies found in the second iteration, including users feeling they needed a better understanding or explanation of the advanced technology features such as drone delivery and scanning features. This led to the users expressing confusion as to what was occuring in the real world as they using the features in the design. The issues revealed were important to consider as part of the redesign process for the final high fidelity prototype.</p>

        </div>

<p class = "para">The next step in the design process of ‘Autonomove’, colour, shape and detail were added to the wireframe to create the High Fidelity mock up showcased. The process of achieving this final design involved user testing, iteration and much altercation. The desired app would need to provide a sleek user interface with relevant colours, and provide a comfortable and clear user experience.<br><br>

To understand which colour palette would be most comfortable and usable for users, the sign up screen was tested with users in different colours using Invision. These think-aloud observations  predominately took place in the environment of a home, as well as exterior to the houses on the street to replicate the real life process. It was concluded that green and red felt the most natural, supportive and non-confronting to users. The brighter blue and red pallet was enjoyed by users but didn’t provide as much clarity as the bold colours were competing for users attention.<br><br>

To proceed with the green and red colour scheme a high fidelity mock up was created with Adobe XD. This resource was efficient and provided ideal animation and simple arrows for user flow.<br><br>
This design was then tested with users, and produced great insights that were not picked up on in the wireframe. It was observed that the back arrow ‘<‘ was too large, causing an uneven ratio and thus a more confused User Interface. The headings were moved to the left so the interface had clear lines. Some of the text was too small and was increased in size.<br><br>

Finally, we achieved our desired product with a non-confronting and usable interface, as showcased below in a user flow diagram. The Adobe XD usable prototype is showcased above.

    <h3>Reviews and Recommendations</h3>

    <p>
The process of creating Autonomove involved many obstacles, shortcomings and eventually growth in way of redesigning, rethinking and reordering the user interface a many stages of the process. The final mock up is how we envisioned, and fulfils our user needs of creating an autonomous removal system which sends all items to multiple locations, allows the user ample security and organisational awareness and ensures they are aware of the location of their personal belongings at all times. <br><br>

However, there is a lot of future opportunity to improve the usability of Autonomove through further user testing and iteration. Upon the conclusion of this project, the reflection unearthed possible logistical problems that could effect the user interface. The problem which may be faced could be having all deliveries arrive at once. This may not be possible if all autonomous vehicles are trucks, rather than a truck, car and drone for example. There are multiple ways to solving this, but for efficiency sake we assume the AI system that calculates which vehicles are delivered to the user could utilise one truck for more than one location; for example. In future this will need to be included on the user interface so the home screen is altered to reflect the real time happenings of the moving event. Furthermore, some titles were misunderstood by one user and understood by all others. This requires further user testing to determine which headings and text is most effective at enhancing the user experience. With all this in mind, priorities may change and the user interface may need to be altered <br>



<br><br>Unfortunately with the time frame and resources we have, we cannot create the perfect app, however in future we recommend action is taken to solve these issues and to create the perfect interface. We believe this resource would be a great use of Autonomous vehicles to enhance the lives of regular people, by removing stress, physical effort and organisation.
