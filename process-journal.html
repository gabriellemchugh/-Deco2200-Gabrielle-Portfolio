    <p > This has been a big semester! I found this project very demanding conceptually, but I feel as though I have learnt alot and got a taste for what a great interface needs and how to achieve that. Throughout the process my group and I faced many challenges, such as rethinking our idea, our wireframe not working at all, our user tests rescheduling and competing ideas. But eventually we believe we have created an app that has great opportunity and fathomable use for autonomous vehicles. The app is not perfect and unfortately requires greater iteration and testing. But it has taught me alot over the 12 weeks, i will go into depth about what we did and how these challenges taught me alot about the design processm and user interfaces. </p>

To begin ideating for our Autonomous Vehicle system, our group and I discussed and brainstormed possible problems that could be solved with Autonomous Vehicles. We came up with a variation, some very small problems and some huge ethical dilemmas. Some of these included autonomous vehicles to help the immobile and elderly. Vehicles to help remove drunk people from the streets. Autonomous Vehicles in the realm of poverty, when collecting water. We very soon realised that we were getting to ahead of ourselves, and trying to solve the issue with an autonomous vehicle without correctly phrasing the question. Logistically, our initial ideas were exciting, but we wondered how we could talk to the immobile and elderly if they were our users, or how we could prevent a drunk person from misuse of our system. We don’t even have a system or a problem to be answered yet!</p><p>



After a week of researching autonomous vehicles and the capabilities that could impact our lives directly, we agreed to focus our area of research and problems to a smaller and more accessible area. The home. We have agreed to try and step back a step and divulge ourselves the problems and niches that can occur in the home for everyday people, without having an answer in mind. We wanted to stretch ourselves and see how we could start this semester by posing a question, rather than an answer. </p><p>



In all honestly, this was very frustrating and tricky to get our heads around. It was so easy to run down the line and go “snap”, we will do a delivery of items you leave at home to wherever you are personally, before we even knew if that were a legitimate issue that a group of users would have.
So for our research projects we have decided to research the niches of the home, and where pain points are during peoples everyday lives. </p>

  Research into the home was far more difficult than we initially expected. Although all journal articles, books and websites revealed information we knew to be true, as we or our families had experienced already, there was ALOT of different pain points for different social groups. This was very frustrating and overwhelming, as we were trying to stick to researching the area, but had ample information to make sense of. We found that the pain points within the home were organisation, time management and just general knowledge about where things are.</p><p>



  Aside from my group, I decided to focus my user research on how the home defines us. Many sources revealed that home for many is a safe space which reflects their identity. It is where they’re comfortable and where they feel they can express themselves. This is for the most part done by the belongings one chooses to have in their home. Some people prefer cleanliness and space, and others prefer many items to surround themselves with and create sense of nostalgia and home. This lead me to researching how it feels to move homes. My boyfriend is in the process of moving homes right now, which was largely my inspiration. His mother is moving to Melbourne and all of his homeliness and belongings that he associates comfort are going to be following her, or moving with him. Its no doubt very full on and emotional, and completely tied into identity and belongings.</p><p>


  So, after researching journals and websites and even social media, I decided to send out a questionnaire. This questionaire asked people to describe some of the emotions they feel when moving house, how often they do so, and how they create a sense of home. Amazingly, I got 50 respondents and their responses matched what I had thought - moving is hard. It is stressful, sad, exciting, nostalgic, chaotic, overwhelming, hard work - to name a few of the words my respondents used. </p><p>


  </p><p>



  I then interviewed the friends I knew in the process of moving, those who had moved before and those who do it regularly. I found, as expected, some peopel were more comfortable with it than others. I then interviewed 2 interior designers on how they create a sense of home within a space. They talked alot about light,colour  and motif and incorporating someones personality into the home. Im not sure this was relevant or helpful in the end, so I think the interior designer interviews will prove unuseful.</p>

  This week we discussed our presentations and put together all of our research, to determine what the question we wanted to answer with autonomous vehicles with. One of the lecturers gave very useful formulas for designing a question and and answer, so we tried to model that.
  My other two group members had focused much more on home organisation than I had, and had found a lot about how time management and organisation. Dom said when asked to describe where something was they’d say “in the living room somewhere”. Although what I had researched was quite different, I brought the fact that alot of people in my interviews found tidying and cleanliness to be very important to their sense of home. Jake also said that with tidiness and order people saved alot of time and stress. This was not a simple process. It was alot of back and forth confusion and “wait what do you mean?”, “what do we really need to solve?”, “How can we do that with an autonomous vehicle”. “What is a vehicle??” “Can we argue that that is a vehicle”. </p><p>



  “Explore ideas for ways that an unorganised individual could be more productive and efficient with time by organising the home with autonomous vehicles”</p><p>



  This seemed to support our research very well. We brainstormed all possible solutions to this area of problem, for unorganised individuals. We thought about an autonomous vehicle cleaning up the house so that a user has more time. And we extended on this as a drone within the house when you are tidying before you clean. We then considered how a drone could help with allergies. Logistically it is hard to work out how a drone would function within a household, when there are children and pets and people filling the spaces. We then decided that it could be a service that is ordered/told to start cleaning up when the user is out of the house, and give a user a time frame for it to be done by.  </p><p>


  But each time we run into the same problem… Is this really a vehicle? Yes we could argue that because it moves something from a to b it is a vehicle, so we decided to proceed. But something didn’t feel quite right.</p><p>



  A week later, This week, we reevaluated out idea. Our tutor Christine brought up the fact that, yes it can be argued that it is a vehicle, however does it make use of the User interface. Does the journey actually matter when you are picking up laundry off the floor and moving it to a new place. Will the user actually care what is happening on that journey?
  And we realise, no it does not. This system we proposed - a clean up service which tidies your house autonomously and the touch and send you an estimated finishing time  - was not an autonomous vehicle experience, it was more like a robot. You don’t care what is happening. </p><p>



  So we were stumped. It was very frustrating to have weeks of discussion and work confused, but I think I learnt a lot in the process. Largely about group communication, understanding the design brief, understanding the area and understanding the question. Christine suggested that something along the lines of moving house might be more applicable to the journey and user interface of an autonomous delivery. </p><p>



  I was excited, as this ties perfectly back to my research!! This helped me to be inspired to rediscover the research I did and look it from my new perspective of growth, where we fully understand the UI aspect of the design brief, and the purpose of a vehicle system.
  We rephrased our design brief and created a problem statement as follows: </p><p>




  “Explore ideas for ways the moving house process (same city) could be more efficient, less taxing and more organised by streamlining the process with autonomous technology”</p><p>



  Defined the problem Areas:
  Packing and unpacking
  The physical moving process
  Security / safety of belongings
  Awareness of where your belonging are</p><p>



  Defined the User Needs:
  Organisation
  Stress prevention
  Reliable service
  Peace of mind while the service is ongoing
  Save Time</p><p>



  When does the user ever need to interact with the drone?
  Packing/unpacking
  Delivery timing
  Updating needs
  Schedule of moving day
  Priority of belongings?</p><p>




  We found that the user needs correlated quite strongly with our home research, but picked an area specific to journey. We are excited to push forward with this idea, after weeks of confusion, discussion and frustration. It’s good for our group to get a win, and feel as though we understand the problem fully. </p>

        <div class="col-md-12">
          <p>
Paper-prototyping was a lot of fun, but a LOT of work. Much more work than I initially thought it would be. We decided to each sketch and create a paper prototype of our ideas and then test them together. My idea was an app which helps you to categorise all the items in your house when you are packing, by you scanning your possession and entering it into the inventory, and ordering an autonomous vehicle, in accordance to its new location (i.e Rubbish Tip, New House, Donation) and the size, weight and delicacy of all the items you own. You would pack the car yourself and then track the autonomous truck, car or drone as it goes to the new destination, and you are altered when they arrive or you receive. In brainstorming I decided I needed a sign up page for security of all your items that will be delivered autonomously, a categorising your items page, an inventory, to do lists that are customisable, a notification of when your moving date is approaching, a calendar that provides guidelines as to tasks to complete. This was all aimed to create a user experience which helped a user through every step of their move, so they felt organised and secure.
I first created a rough user flow and began sketching possible home screens for the user. When that was decided upon, and the user flow was perfected I drew all the screens. There was more than I thought there would be, as each process required awareness and viewing. </p><p>



To test this first iteration, we used the Invision App to create hotspots on images on the screen. This resource was very cool and my first 3 users testers were impressed. I utilised the think aloud method and recorded their responses, whilst asking them to ‘Pack a box to donate, and then deliver it to donation.’. This was somewhat successful, users liked the concept, however thought the screen was too confusing as it had too many items on it. They were visibly struggling to know where to click next to proceed, and there was not any option for going backwards for error correction.</p><p>


I then fixed these problems with a new set of paper prototype sketches, which were then transferred to invision and tested with 2 more subjects. This was more successful as users were not confused about where to click, but commented that to user flow could be improved. They weren’t sure why they were signing up and then going to security later. They were a little overwhelmed with the process.</p><p>



My other group members had simpler idea. One was an autonomous truck which you pack yourself with instruction from the app, which delivers your items autonomously to the new house. And a priority moving system which took some of your items to your new house ahead of time, in accordance to what you need, for users with busy schedules who didn’t have time to do it all in one go. </p>

  With all our 3 ideas having been tested and iterated with multiple users, we decided to focus on the multiple location removalist system, but with strengths of the priority booking, and autonomous truck included. Achieving this idea was no easy feat. I think I was prone to a bit of stubbornness of what we would scrap and not as it was based off my initial design. My initial design was aimed at the entire process of moving, and my group members argued that we should focus simply on organising your items and delivering them to the different locations. I envisioned this interface helping you throughout the weeks before by providing a calendar schedule and reminders coming up to your moving date. We agreed to exclude calendar and categorisation and create a more streamlined process with more user freedom for the date they want to order their vehicles. I think it was very important that I drop my stubbornness and listen to my group members, I believe our projected will be much clearer and more efficient because of it.

  <ul>
  We sketched up a user interface wireframe that included
  <li>
  sign up with password and moving location, and other desired destinations
  <li>A choice of security level
  <li>Stickers that are delivered by drone to categorise your items
  <li>Drone that scans all the items in your house
  <li>Ability to order autonomous vehicles at a preferred date and time
  <li>Ability to track the vehicle from when its coming to when it arrives at the next destination

  </ul>

    <img src = "./img/autonomover/6.png">
    <img src = "./img/autonomover/7.png">

  </div>

  </p><p>
  We then tested this prototype with 9 people by use of walkthrough and think aloud observation. For me, and for the others, this user evaluation was a bit of a train wreck. It was essential we test this as the users noticed so many flaws, inconsistencies and lack of user freedom within the app. Everything was going wrong and the concept was poorly understood. Users couldn’t go back and the user flow was confusing without explaination. Users also were observed trying to click on things that weren’t buttons etc.
  </p><p>
  This was very frustrating, but also very enlightening and is it enabled us to get outside our own heads and look at the app we are creating from a 3rd person perspective. We completely redesigned the aesthetic of the app, so that there was greater consistency, priority  was cleared and the use of negative space was greater. </p><p>


  We then tested this with 8 more users, and the feedback was much more positive. Users felt the interface was comfortable clear and easy to follow. They did not make many errors in pressing items, and the questions were mostly about the logistics of the move and imagining their personal experience of it. We feel we managed to get people to connect with this app with the improvements we made. It was very successful.
  User testing and evaluation proved extremely useful, and enlightening as you think you have communicated your design correctly, but when people have no knowledge of your ideas, there are huge gaps. It showed me how essential this is. </p>

We experimented with colour, and altered some of our titles, font and icons to create better ratios for a nicer and clearer interface. This was done with reference to Google Materials and Pinterest -great sources for inspiration and made our design look clearer against the colour schemes we were testing. We tried out red and blue, light blue and dark blue, and red and Green as the main colours and asked friends to evaluate what they liked best. It was found that Red and green was the most calming and relevant to the environment of moving homes, and felt secure. The other colour schemes were nice but were competing for attention with bright colours, or were too calm. </p><p>
We put this into adobe xd to create animation. It was very exciting to see our app come to life with animation,and the service was very easy to use. </>

    <p>
The process of creating Autonomove involved many obstacles, shortcomings and eventually growth in way of redesigning, rethinking and reordering the user interface a many stages of the process. The final mock up is how we envisioned, and fulfils our user needs of creating an autonomous removal system which sends all items to multiple locations, allows the user ample security and organisational awareness and ensures they are aware of the location of their personal belongings at all times. <br><br>

<br><br>Unfortunately with the time frame and resources we have, we cannot create the perfect app, however in future we recommend action is taken to solve these issues and to create the perfect interface. We believe this resource would be a great use of Autonomous vehicles to enhance the lives of regular people, by removing stress, physical effort and organisation.
